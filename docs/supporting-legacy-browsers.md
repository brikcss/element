# Supporting legacy browsers

This documentation is coming soon.

<!-- Babel, with its preset environment plugin, allows you to compile your JavaScript code to target your intended environment. File/module bundlers can optimize your code and output it however you like. Combine the two and suddenly you can easily serve one version of your code to modern browsers, and a totally different version to legacy browsers. -->
